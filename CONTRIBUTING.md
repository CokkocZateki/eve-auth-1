# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to EVE-Auth!

### Should you read this guide?

The answer is yes! Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### How can you contribute to EVE-Auth

EVE-Auth is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from the community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from improving documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into EVE-Auth itself.

### What should you not do

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [contact@anthonygrimes.co.uk](mailto:contact@anthonygrimes.co.uk) instead. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

# Ground Rules

### Your Responsibilities

* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to EVE-Auth ? You can start by checking if there are any beginner or help-wanted issues:

* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

# How to report a bug/issue

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [contact@anthonygrimes.co.uk](mailto:contact@anthonygrimes.co.uk) instead. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email myself at [contact@anthonygrimes.co.uk](mailto:contact@anthonygrimes.co.uk).

### How to file a bug/issue report

A template has been provided as `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.MD` in the root directory for you. This document shall also give some guidance on your bug/issue reports.

General questions should be directed to myself at [contact@anthonygrimes.co.uk](mailto:contact@anthonygrimes.co.uk) instead of the issue tracker. I'll respond as quickly as I can.

### How to make a pull request:

A template has been provided as `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.MD` in the root directory for you. This document shall also give you some guidance on you pull request.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

EVE-Auth is designed foremost to be simple for the user and readable for the developer. Please ensure that if you are suggesting a new feature or enhancement that you keep these two simple values in mind.

All features are welcomed and can be assigned the label 'feature request' in the issue tracker.

# Code review process

I alone currently look at Pull Requests. However I aim to look at Pull Requests within 24-48 hours of submission. Once I have given feedback I'd expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks I may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community

Feel free to reach out to myself for any reason at my public email [contact@anthonygrimes.co.uk](mailto:contact@anthonygrimes.co.uk). I love meeting new people!
